# Final Step: Add TypeScript Types and Polish

## Your Mission
Time to make your game production-ready! You'll add TypeScript types for better code safety and add some visual polish.

## What You Need to Build

### 1. Add TypeScript Types
Create a type definition at the top of your file:
- Define a type called `Choice` that can only be `'rock'`, `'paper'`, or `'scissors'`
- Use this type for your function parameters instead of `string`

### 2. Update Function Signatures
Update your functions to use the `Choice` type:
- `determineWinner(player: Choice, computer: Choice): string`
- `playGame(choice: Choice)`
- Update your state variables to use `Choice | ''` for choices

### 3. Add Emojis to Buttons
Make your buttons more visually appealing:
- Rock button: `ü™® Rock`
- Paper button: `üìÑ Paper`
- Scissors button: `‚úÇÔ∏è Scissors`

### 4. Improve Result Messages
Make the result messages more user-friendly:
- Change `'player'` to `'You win!'`
- Change `'computer'` to `'Computer wins!'`
- Change `'tie'` to `'It\'s a tie!'`

### 5. Add CSS Classes
Add className attributes to your elements for styling:
- Main container: `className="game"`
- Score section: `className="score"`
- Button container: `className="choices"`
- Results section: `className="results"`
- Result text: `className="result"`
- Reset button: `className="reset-btn"`

### 6. Update Score Logic
Since you changed the result messages, update your score logic:
- Check for `'You win!'` instead of `'player'`
- Check for `'Computer wins!'` instead of `'computer'`

## Hints
- TypeScript types help catch errors before they happen
- The `Choice` type prevents invalid choices like `'banana'`
- Emojis make the UI more engaging
- CSS classes will help with styling later

## Success Check
Your final game should have:
- TypeScript types that prevent errors
- Emojis on all buttons
- Friendly result messages
- CSS classes for styling
- All functionality working perfectly

## Congratulations!
You've built a complete, production-ready rock-paper-scissors game! You've learned:
- React components and state management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Event handling and user interaction
- Code organization and refactoring
- Progressive development from simple logic to full UI

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add CSS styling to make it look beautiful
- Add animations when buttons are clicked
- Save high scores in localStorage
- Add sound effects
- Deploy it to the web!
