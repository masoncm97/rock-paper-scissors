# Rock Paper Scissors - Step by Step Learning

This folder contains the progressive build-up of the Rock Paper Scissors game, designed to teach programming concepts step by step.

## How to Use These Steps

Each file shows a different stage of development. Start with Step 1 and work your way up to understand how the complete game was built.

### Step 1: App-1.tsx - Core Game Logic
**Concepts:** Functions, conditional logic, console output
- Just the basic rules of rock-paper-scissors
- No React, no UI - pure logic
- Test in browser console

### Step 2: App-2.tsx - Add Computer Choice
**Concepts:** Arrays, random numbers, function composition
- Adds computer opponent
- Generates random choices
- Complete game logic in console

### Step 3: App-3.tsx - Basic React Component
**Concepts:** React components, useState hook, event handlers
- First React component
- Simple UI with buttons
- One piece of state (result)

### Step 4: App-4.tsx - Display Choices
**Concepts:** Multiple state variables, conditional rendering
- Shows what each player chose
- More state management
- Better user feedback

### Step 5: App-5.tsx - Add Scoring
**Concepts:** State updates, score tracking
- Keeps track of wins/losses
- Score display
- Persistent game state

### Step 6: App-6.tsx - Reset and Improve Logic
**Concepts:** Reset functionality, code refactoring
- Reset button to start over
- Improved win logic using objects
- Better code organization

### Final: App-final.tsx - Complete Game
**Concepts:** TypeScript types, styling, polish
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Emojis and styling
- Production-ready code

## Teaching Approach

1. **Start with Step 1** - Explain the basic logic
2. **Test in console** - Show how to run and test the code
3. **Add one concept at a time** - Don't overwhelm with too many new ideas
4. **Ask questions** - "What do you think this does?" "How could we improve this?"
5. **Let them experiment** - Encourage small changes and see what happens

## Key Learning Moments

- **Step 1-2:** Pure logic and functions
- **Step 3:** Introduction to React and state
- **Step 4-5:** State management and user interaction
- **Step 6:** Code organization and refactoring
- **Final:** TypeScript and production considerations

## Questions to Ask

- "What happens when we click a button?"
- "How does the computer know what to choose?"
- "Why do we need state variables?"
- "How could we make the game more fun?"
- "What if we wanted to add sound effects?"

## Next Steps After Completion

- Add animations
- Implement local storage for high scores
- Add different difficulty levels
- Create a multiplayer version
- Deploy to the web
